# micro-builder-cli

Build your micro-frontend Architecture or start your servers in one command line inspired by [nextjs-micro-front-ends](https://github.com/tkssharma/nextjs-micro-frontends/tree/master).

With micro-builder-cli you are able to run all your micro-servers for your micro-front-end features at same time.
This tool was designed with nodeJS in mind, for its performance in system subprocesses and for the development environment it represents.
